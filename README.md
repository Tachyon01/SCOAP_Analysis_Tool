# Semester_Project
SCOAP Analysis Tool:
Developed a tool which performs SCOAP analysis  of digital  circuit  test-ability. 
Starting from a HDL(verilog) description of a circuit, 
Generating its gate level netlist, 
Parsing the same to obtain the controllability and observability values at every wire in the circuit.

Steps:
Simply Run The Wrapper

Side Notes:
You may need to change the name of files and Top module in Wrapper and in Python File

Requirements:
Download all the files at one location(directory) including .exe, .v and various other files.

We have used Yosys: http://www.clifford.at/yosys/  and SCOAP tool: https://sourceforge.net/projects/testabilitymeasurementtool/ as primary tools for the project
